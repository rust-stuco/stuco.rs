### 98-008: Intro to the Rust Programming Language

# Iter Lab

The goal of this homework is to make sure you are comfortable with Rust's Iterators and Closures.

This homework is more puzzle-oriented than the last few homeworks, where instead of implementing
one relatively complicated thing, you will implement 6 somewhat-less-complicated things.

Since we're already halfway through the semester, we will be providing less guidance in this
writeup. Remember, you just need to make the tests pass!

Since you know how to read tests now, we encourage you to read some of the tests
_before_ you start writing any code.

All tests are located in `src/tests.rs`.

### Formatting and Style

The autograder will run these two commands on your code:

```sh
cargo clippy && cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

**If the autograder detects any errors from the command above, you will not be able to receive**
**any points.** This may seem strict, but we have decided to follow standard best practices for
Rust.

By following [Rust's style guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/), you ensure
that anybody reading your code (who is familiar with Rust) will be able to easily navigate your
code. This can help with diving into an unfamiliar code base, and it also eliminates the need for
debate with others over style rules, saving time and energy.

See the official [guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/) for more information.

### Unix

If you are on a unix system, we will try to create a `handin.zip` automatically for you,
**but you will need to have `zip` already installed**.

If you _do not_ have `zip` installed on your system, install `zip` on your machine or use the CMU
Linux SSH machines. If you need help with this, please reach out to us!

Once you have `zip` installed, we will create the `handin.zip` automatically for you (_take a peek_
_into `build.rs` file if you're interested in how this works!_).

Once you have the `handin.zip` file, submit it (and only the zip) to Gradescope.

### Windows

If you are on a windows system, you can zip the `src/` folder manually and upload that to
Gradescope.

Note that you don't _need_ to name it `handin.zip`, you can name it whatever you'd like.

# Collaboration

In general, feel free to discuss homeworks with other students! As long as you do not copy someone
else's work, any communication is fair game.

# Feedback

We would like to reiterate that you should let us know if you spent anywhere in significant excess
of an hour on this homework.

In addition, Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve, so if you find yourself not understanding
the concepts, you should reach out to us and let us know as well --- chances are, you're not the
only one!
